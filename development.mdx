### **1. AI-Driven Arbitrage Execution**

* Scans multiple Solana-based DEXs (Orca, Raydium, Phoenix, etc.) for arbitrage opportunities.

* Utilizes a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model to determine profitable trade execution after accounting for fees and slippage.

* Supports flash loans (if feasible) to execute trades without upfront capital.

### **2. MEV Attack Detection & Protection**

* Anomaly detection AI monitors transaction patterns to identify frontrunning and sandwich attacks.

* Routes trades through alternative liquidity pools or delays execution to minimize loss.

* Integrates with Jito-Solana (optional) for MEV-aware transaction routing.

### **3. Solana Native Smart Contracts**

* Rust-based Solana program executes arbitrage trades and protects against MEV attacks.

* On-chain AI-powered risk assessment before executing transactions.

* Stores executed trades and maintains a profitability log.

### **4. Real-Time Liquidity & Pricing Data**

* Fetches real-time price feeds fromÂ **Pyth, Switchboard, and on-chain DEX APIs**.

* Monitors liquidity depth to avoid slippage traps.

* Uses AI to predict short-term price fluctuations for optimal trade timing.

### **5. API & SDK for Developers**

* Provides an easy-to-integrate SDK or API for:

  * Wallets (e.g., Phantom, Solflare) to offer MEV-protected swaps.

  * DeFi protocols to automate arbitrage execution.

  * Traders to access real-time risk-adjusted arbitrage signals.
